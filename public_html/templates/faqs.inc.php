         it may be completely different for you. <br />If you are seeking recovery I suggest you get medical help first &amp; consult your medical team first if you are wanting to make any changes to your diet or recovery.

        <p>I get a lot of questions about my recovery, my diet now &amp; just general advice needing situations.</p>
        <p> I love to answer these &amp; I thought i would put together a FAQ page as I often get the same question repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Feel free to ask me more questions through the <a href="./?page=contact">contact page</a> or on social media. I am happy to chat.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What did you eat today?</p>
  <small>I get this one so often! It makes me laugh every time. My intake changes everyday &amp;
 I don't have a certain diet or anything that I generally stick to.<br><br> I like to eat whatever, whenever although I do stick to plant-based, wholefoods as that is what my body craves &amp; thrives on. <br/><br>
A normal day for more starts with usually a raw breakfast (smoothie bowl, bircher muesli, chia pudding, lots of fruit w rawnola), sometimes I will have avocado on GF toast if I crave that or GF cornflakes &amp; almond milk. Sometimes I will have cooked oats or cooked veggies, mainly in the winter.<br/><br>

Lunch is always different, a big salad, a chickpea curry w rice, a GF sandwich with falafel. basically something w plant based protein, carbohydrates, fats &amp; vegetables. I will have a similar type thing for dinner, covering all the food groups.<br /><br>

Snacks, I have CONSTANTLY throughout the day - i'm basically always snacking. My favorites at the moment are bliss balls, raw slice/cheesecake (yes, for me, that is a snack), avocado, nuts, medjool dates w PB or tahini, PB by the spoonful, brown rice crackers w hummus.<br /><br> Basically anything plant based &amp; unprocessed I will eat at any time in the day.

  <p>How long did it take you to recover?</p>
  <small>
  This is a hard question to answer as it has been an up and down journey for me- I have recovered and relapsed a few times now BUT I wouldn't say that relapse is inevitable is recovery.<br><br>

This final stretch of recovery for me since my last relapse probably took about 4-5 months of saying I wanted to get better and half-heartedly attempting recovery and then 9 month of being absolutely determined to get this illness out of my life for good.<br><br>

 You can do anything you put your mind too and it doesn't have to take that long or it could take longer- everyone is different & when it comes to recovery you really have to roll with the punches. <br><br>

<em>As long as you want it enough, it will happen.</em><br><br>

I would say I am pretty much fully recovered now - I still get thoughts and urges to engage in behaviors but they are just silly whispers now and I am not compelled to engage in that.<br><br>
