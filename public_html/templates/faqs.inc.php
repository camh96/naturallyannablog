  <strong>Disclaimer!</strong><br> Please note that I am, in no way, a medical professional - these are just some things I have learnt in my journey &amp;
         it may be completely different for you. <br />If you are seeking recovery I suggest you get medical help first &amp; consult your medical team first if you are wanting to make any changes to your diet or recovery.
</div>

        <p>I get a lot of questions about my recovery, my diet now &amp; just general advice needing situations.</p>
        <p> I love to answer these &amp; I thought i would put together a FAQ page as I often get the same question repeatedly.</p>
        <p>Feel free to ask me more questions through the <a href="./?page=contact">contact page</a> or on social media. I am more than happy to chat.</p>
